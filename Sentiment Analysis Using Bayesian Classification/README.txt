Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes Classification in Python.
Using a large collection of positive and negative movie reviews,  
the Naive Bayes classifier model predicts the sentiment of the corresponding movie review.
Unigram features are used in the bayes.py implementation, and the feature space is extended further   
using Bigrams in the bayesbest.py file.
